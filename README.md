# Vector-space embedding training framework

This is a framework which can train CNN models for embedding images into vector space using the 
triplet loss function introduced in the [FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832) paper.

This work is part of my thesis, where my goal was to train CNN models for identifying humpback whales from images.
The idea and the dataset comes from the [Happywhale](https://happywhale.com/) platform and the Kaggle 
[Humpback Whale Identification Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/humpback-whale-identification).
The methods and also some of the CNN architecture I used here are based on [FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832).

For try, you can download the framework from [here](https://github.com/zsoltpocsai/vse_training_fw/releases/latest).
User guide can be found [here](docs). I didn't include the example dataset, but you can download the full size
one from [Humpback Whale Identification Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/humpback-whale-identification).
